# Ocatvia

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.5.

# Monorepo

## Repo 1: Web App
I have created a simple Angular App that will at some stage be turned into a website but is currently being used as a playground to develop the NPM package.
run `yarn`
To start from root run `yarn start:web`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8400/`.

## Repo 2: NPM Package
Work in progress, the main thing in here at the moment is an animation, you can find this component under `Octavia > src > lib > animations`
